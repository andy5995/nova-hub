# Changelog

All notable changes to Nova Hub will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Sample client config on the BBS's page.** The Client Information card
  links a `config.toml` (Linux) and `config.psd1` (Windows) for the BBS, for
  its own sysops and admins (`GET /clients/{id}/config/{linux|windows}`). It
  is the file a claim hands back, with the hub address, client ID and
  current leagues filled in, but the secret is a CHANGE-ME like the game
  paths: the hub keeps only its hash. Downloading changes nothing.

### Changed
- **API docs are split per API and kept current.** `docs/API.md` and
  `docs/openapi.json` mixed both APIs in one file with one shared schema
  list, and had not been regenerated since 0.5.0. `export_api_docs.py` now
  writes `docs/service-api.{json,md}` and `docs/management-api.{json,md}`,
  each spec exactly what that API serves at its `openapi.json`, keys sorted
  (the service spec is the one `export_openapi.py` gives nova-client).
  `tests/test_api_docs.py` fails while they are stale, so regenerate them in
  the commit that changes an API, a release's version bump included.
- **The live rig drives the games through sr-harness.** The rig's pty runner,
  screen driver, 8.3 guard and BRE player walk were split out as the
  standalone `lime/sr-harness` library (which also plays Falcon's Eye), and
  the rig now installs it, pinned to v0.1.1, from `tests/live/requirements.txt`.
  CI installs it too. Test-only: nothing in the product changed.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added
- **Sysops apply to join; the admin approves.** A public `/join` page takes a
  signed-in sysop's BBS details (name, sysop alias, location, address, OS) and
  the leagues they want. The admin reviews the queue under Admin >
  Applications, picking each league's BBS number and FTN address (suggested:
  the BBS's number elsewhere, else the lowest free one). Approving creates the
  BBS, makes the applicant its owner, adds the memberships, regenerates the
  leagues' nodelists and issues a claim link bound to the applicant, all in
  one transaction. Rejecting records a note the sysop sees. A sysop can
  withdraw while it waits; one waiting application per account.
- **More leagues from the console.** An owner asks for more leagues on their
  BBS's page; approval adds the memberships, and the credentials don't change.
- **Claim links bound to an account.** Only that account, signed in, can
  claim one, so a forwarded link is useless to anyone else. Approval issues
  them; the admin can also bind a link to one of a BBS's owners. The bound
  sysop collects it from their BBS's page. Unbound links still work for a
  sysop with no account.
- **Verify progress** on each BBS's page: Approved, Credentials claimed,
  First sign-in, First upload, Active (seen in the last two days), so a node
  stuck at a step shows without asking. The hub now records each BBS's first
  sign-in and first upload; the upgrade fills both in for BBSes already
  running.

### Changed
- Attacks & Traffic labels each league with its number and game ("015B
  Medusa Test League 015"), since a BRE and an FE league can share a name,
  and has a Refresh button that keeps the filters.
- The console's sidebar stays the height of the window, so sign-out and the
  version stay on screen on a long page.

### Fixed
- Opening /join or /how-it-works directly while signed out went to the
  sign-in page instead.

### Upgrading
- One migration: the applications table, each BBS's first sign-in and first
  upload (filled in from its history), and claim links bound to an account.
  Claim links already issued stay unbound and keep working.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-12

### Added
- **A public "How it works" page** at `/how-it-works`, for a sysop deciding
  whether to join. It maps each FTN piece (mailer, session password, tosser,
  nodelist, maintenance event) to what replaces it, says what stays on their
  machine, which client to run on Windows or Linux, what a good first run
  looks like, and the gotchas that have bitten live nodes. No sign-in needed;
  linked from the sign-in page and from claim links. The client download is
  the page's call to action; the hub's own source sits apart in a "For the
  curious" box.
- `export_openapi.py` writes the Service API's OpenAPI spec as JSON, with the
  hub version in `info.version`. nova-client vendors it as
  `openapi/service-api.json` and checks its mock hub against it in CI.
- Nodelist downloads honour conditional requests (#80).
  `GET /service/api/v1/leagues/{id}/nodelist` answers `304 Not Modified` to a
  matching `If-None-Match`, or to an `If-Modified-Since` no older than the
  file. The hub already sent `ETag` and `Last-Modified` but never answered 304,
  so the PowerShell client re-fetched an unchanged nodelist on every sync. A
  304 leaves `downloaded_at` alone, so it still means the last real transfer.
- An admin can rename a league and edit its description from the league's
  Edit dialog. The name is only shown in the console; the league number and
  game, which the games and nodelists use, don't change. Each edit to a
  league is recorded in the audit log.

### Fixed
- Deleting a BBS that was still in a league failed with a server error. The
  hub now refuses, naming the leagues, and the Delete dialog says so before
  you press it: remove the BBS from its leagues first.
- **"Routes/BBS info command failed: Unknown error" after every run (#83, #85).**
  BRE and FE end `ROUTEINFO` and `BBSINFO` with DOS errorlevel 1 even when they
  succeed. Since 0.3.0 passed the real exit code through (`script -e`), each
  working run logged two false warnings (1,204 pairs on production since
  2026-09-10), while `routes.lst` and `bbsinfo.lst` were written and ingested
  every time. These two commands are now judged by whether their listing file
  was written during the run, and a warning names the stale file when it was not.
- **No more "Unknown error".** A non-zero dosemu exit now reports its exit code
  and transcript path, for every command including `PLANETARY`.
- **Hub logs are plain text in the journal (#84).** loguru was forced to colour
  its output, and journald stores a line containing ANSI escapes as an array of
  byte values, so hub lines reached OpenObserve as `["27","91",...]` and could
  not be searched. Colour is now used only when stdout is a terminal.

### Upgrading
- `backfill_attacks.py` fills the Attacks and Traffic views from the packets
  still on disk, for an upgrade from 0.4.0 or earlier. It only adds rows and
  can be run again safely.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added
- **Claim links** replace sending a client secret over chat. An admin issues
  one from the BBS's page; the sysop opens it and presses Claim, and the hub
  generates the secret then and shows it once, with a ready-made client config
  (`config.psd1` for Windows, `config.toml` for Linux) listing their leagues
  and BBS numbers. A link works once, expires after 72 hours, and a newer one
  supersedes it; a used link says when and from what IP. Only the token's hash
  is stored. Opening the link changes nothing -- claiming is a button -- so a
  chat app's link preview cannot use it up.
- `[server] public_url`: the address sysops reach the hub at, used in claim
  links and the configs they hand out.
- `GET /service/api/v1/me`: the calling BBS and the active leagues it is in,
  with its BBS index in each. Nova Client's connection test
  (`--test-connection` / `-TestConnection`) compares these with its config,
  and the claim page now tells sysops to run it first.
- **Address book** (`/address-book`): every BBS against every active league,
  with its index and FTN address in each. A BBS whose index differs between
  leagues is flagged.
- Adding a BBS to a league pre-fills its index from its other leagues when
  they agree, and says so when they do not.
- **FTN addresses belong to the BBS.** An address is held by one BBS, unique
  across the hub, and a BBS may hold several; each league membership links to
  one of its own BBS's addresses. Before this an address was free text on each
  membership, and production had `135:135/20` assigned to two BBSes in two
  leagues. Admins assign, renumber and remove addresses on the client page; an
  address still used by a league cannot be removed.
- **Edit a league membership** in place -- its BBS index and address -- rather
  than deleting and re-adding it. `PATCH /leagues/{id}/members/{membership_id}`.
- **Download a league's current nodelist** from the league page, and from each
  membership on the client page (`GET /leagues/{id}/nodelist`).
- `tools/release.sh <tag>` publishes a version's section of this file as the
  release notes on GitHub and gitea.
- MIT licence.
- **Sysop accounts.** Sysops sign in through an identity provider (WorkOS
  AuthKit), configured in a new `[identity]` table; with it unset the hub
  works as before. The first sign-in makes a sysop account that owns nothing
  and sees nothing until an admin adds it as a BBS's sysop (the new Sysops
  card on the client page). The hub admin's password still works, as the way
  in when the provider is down. A sign-in is never attached to an existing
  account by matching email: an admin issues a **sign-in link** from the Users
  page, which works once, for 72 hours, for the account it names. Admins can
  also remove an account's sign-in.
- **What a sysop sees** is limited, on the server, to their own BBSes and the
  leagues those are active in: dashboard, alerts, processing runs (their own
  packets, no transcript), leagues (active members, no install paths), the
  address book and nodelists. Anything else is a 404. A test fails if a
  management route is added without either admin-only or this scope.
- **Audit log** (`/admin/audit`, `GET /audit`): who created, changed or
  deleted a BBS, issued or used a claim or sign-in link, assigned an FTN
  address, added an owner, or changed a user or role, with when and from what
  IP.

### Changed
- Each game's names (letter, code, nodelist and nodes-file names) live in one
  table, `backend/services/games.py`, mirrored in `frontend/src/games.ts`. An
  unknown game letter is now an error instead of being treated as Falcon's Eye.
  Contributed by Andy Alt (GitHub PR #1).

- Movements, attacks and the traffic view are admin-only: they show every
  league's game intelligence.
- An admin cannot remove their own admin role.

### Removed
- `PUT /leagues/{id}/members/{membership_id}/bbs-index` and `.../fidonet`,
  replaced by the `PATCH` above.

### Upgrading
- Migration `a7d3e9f15b20` copies each membership's address onto its BBS. It
  refuses, naming them, if one address is held by more than one BBS; give one of
  them a different address and re-run. Nothing is changed until it succeeds.
- Migrations `6d2f8a41c9e7` and `9a4b2e7c1f05` add provider sign-in to user
  accounts, BBS owners, the audit log and sign-in links. Existing accounts
  keep their passwords.
- To turn on provider sign-in, fill in `[identity]` (see
  `config.toml.example`) and register
  `<public_url>/management/api/v1/auth/sso/callback` as a redirect URI with
  the provider. Then connect the admin account's own sign-in with a link from
  the Users page.
- Reinstall the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`): `httpx` is
  now needed at runtime, for provider sign-in, and `aiohttp` moves to 3.14.3.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-17

Shows what the games actually exchanged, and stops guessing about what went
missing.

The question this release answers -- "a player says an attach went missing in
transit, what does the hub know?" -- turned out not to be answerable by counting
sequence numbers. Both games burn a number at every game-day rollover, so across
eight months of production data every busy route shows exactly one lone missing
number per active day (232 days of 239 on one route, 237 of 241 on another, 109
of 111 on a third), each at that route's own maintenance time. A lone gap is the
game working normally and cannot be told apart from a real loss. So the answer is
no longer an alarm; it is the games' own account of what moved, shown to someone
who knows what their league should look like.

### Added
- **Movements.** Every item the games exchange -- its type, and which node sent
  it to which -- is read from each run's `/DETAILED` output and recorded in
  `processing_run_items`. A new `/movements` page leads with the shape of the
  traffic (by type, by node pair, by day) and a filterable table underneath;
  each processing run gains a "What Moved" tab grouped by route. Stored rather
  than parsed on demand because retention drops transcripts after 30 days, and a
  history that silently empties after a month is worse than none.
- `tools/backfill_movements.py` recovers movements from transcripts still held
  on existing runs -- about 1,176 runs on production, the retention window.
  Report-only by default, skips runs already recorded, inserts only.
- `tests/live/serve.py` serves the rig's hub with a real uvicorn and the built
  frontend, so the UI can be looked at with real rig data. `--build` plays an
  actual round first. The scenarios drive the hub in-process, so until now
  nothing listened and the rig's UI could not be seen at all.

### Changed
- **Sequence gap alerting is off by default** (`[processing]
  sequence_alerts_enabled`). Enabled, it fires about three times a day on
  production and every one of them is the daily rollover described above; the
  real loss it exists to catch would arrive as the fourth identical line that
  day. That is how the previous detector reached 705 unresolved false alerts and
  made a genuine loss unfindable. Gaps are still detected and recorded either
  way -- what is switched off is ringing a bell about them. Set it true to
  restore the alerts.
- Sequence alerts, when enabled, are bounded to recent gaps
  (`sequence_alert_max_age_days`, default 14). A missing packet is actionable
  only while it might still be chased. Against production's history: no bound
  599 alerts, 30 days 90, 14 days 42, 7 days 21.

### Fixed
- The transcript parser invented item types. dosemu repaints the emulated
  screen, and a painted line runs two records together with no separator, so a
  loose type pattern ran past the end of the first record and reported types
  like `Recon Request DeCompress: Old: 2 New: 2 %: 0.0% Type: Recon Request`.
  Harmless in a command-line tool, a row in a table someone reads once it is a
  product feature. It also existed in two copies, which is how the bug survived
  in one after being understood in the other; both are now thin wrappers over
  `backend/services/transcript_service.py`.

### Fixed
- Sequence gap detection was blind on every route that had wrapped, which by now
  is every busy route in production. Wrap-around was *inferred* -- sort the
  numbers, find the one gap wider than 500, splice there -- which can represent
  exactly one wrap. League 3's route 02->01 has sent 5,891 packets over eight
  cycles, and sorted into a set those collapse into a flawless 000-999 run with
  no gap to find, so the detector reported nothing missing there no matter what
  went astray. Cycles are now counted from arrival order instead, and the gap
  arithmetic runs in a space that only increases, where a wrap is a step of one
  and needs no special case.
- A game reset restarts the numbering early, and used to look like either a wrap
  or a loss of everything between where the game stopped and 999. Resets are now
  told apart from wraps by where the old cycle ended, and the distance across one
  is not counted as missing packets. Production's busiest route has two, at 494
  and 633.

- Gap detection reported a confident "no gaps" on the hub's own outbound routes,
  which it cannot know. Packets the hub generates are recorded by
  `collect_outbound_packets`, which updates the existing row when a filename is
  reissued rather than adding one -- right for delivery, since it resets
  `is_downloaded` so the client re-fetches, but it means a wrapped route's rows
  are a fixed table of 1,000 slots instead of a history. Those routes are now
  skipped rather than given a false all-clear.

### Added
- `tests/live/rig/grind.sh` walks a rig install through the whole sequence space,
  and `tests/live/rig/dupseq.sh` checks whether a receiving game accepts a
  reissued filename. Both run unattended.
- `sequence_alerts.sequence_epoch` records which time round the numbering a gap
  was, so an alert is identified per cycle. Without it "missing 992" names one
  packet per cycle and a stale alert could swallow a real loss.
- `tools/sequence_timeline.py` reports a route's wraps and resets from exported
  data, without running the hub.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed
- Retention honoured `retention_days` in the database and ignored it on disk.
  Every dosemu transcript is written to `<data_dir>/logs/dosemu/*.log` before it
  is copied into `ProcessingRun.dosemu_log`, so blanking the column left the
  file: production held 53,930 log files and 860 MB across eight months while
  the database tier was working correctly. The daily pass now deletes aged log
  files too, bounded to that one directory and to `.log` files in it, without
  recursing or following symlinks.

### Added
- `deploy.sh` prunes its own database backups, keeping the three most recent.
  Each deploy leaves a ~70 MB copy, and nothing had a ceiling.
- `deploy/deploy.sh` and `deploy/prune_backups.sh` are in the repository. The
  script that deploys production had existed only on production.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed
- The login page carried `Nova Hub v0.2.0` as a literal, which is where the
  version was read from and which had been wrong since 0.2.0. It is now baked in
  from `package.json` at build time -- the page cannot ask the API, being the
  page you see when you are not authenticated -- and a test fails if a version
  is hardcoded in a `.vue` file again, or if the frontend and backend versions
  drift apart.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-14

First tagged release since 0.1.0, and the version production is pinned to.
Thirty-five commits; the ones that change behaviour:

### Security
- Service tokens carry a `type` claim, so a management session token can no
  longer be presented to the service API or the reverse. Every token issued
  before the upgrade is rejected; clients re-authenticate on their next sync.
- Rate limiting counts failed authentication attempts only, so a healthy client
  cannot trip it.
- `min_password_length` and `cookie_secure` are stated rather than inherited.

### Added
- Two-tier retention. `retention_days` was configured, documented and never
  read for the life of the project; it now blanks aged transcripts and generated
  file bodies while keeping every row, count and filename. `VACUUM` stays an
  opt-in operator step.
- Out-of-band alerting via email or webhook, disabled until a transport is
  configured.
- `packets_unconsumed` on a processing run: packets copied into a game's inbound
  folder that the game never ingested are counted and left in place to be
  retried, instead of being deleted along with the evidence.
- A live test rig on real dosemu with real games, covering BRE and Falcon's Eye.
- `GET /management/api/v1/system/version` reports version, commit, commit date
  and whether the deployed tree is dirty. The admin sidebar shows it.
- City, state and country on clients, and the hub's per-league FidoNet address
  and routing mode on leagues, all editable in the UI.

### Fixed
- Generated nodelists contained no node 1 and no `HOST` routing line, because
  the hub has no client record to iterate. They are now written from config plus
  the league's own address, with CRLF endings, atomically, and generation
  refuses rather than overwriting a good file with a partial one.
- Dosemu failures were reported as successes: `script` masked the child's exit
  code, so a run that never started was recorded as completed.
- Sequence gap detection no longer raises false alerts on sparse routes or at
  wraparound.
- Multi-league processing attributed generated files to the wrong league.
- League deletion failed on foreign key constraints.

### Removed
- The WebSocket endpoints, which nothing in either the hub or the client used.

## Known issues

### A genuine Falcon's Eye packet loss does not raise an alert
The sequence validator's density and stride gates stop `015F`'s naturally sparse
numbering from raising false alerts, but the cost is symmetrical: a real lost
Falcon's Eye packet no longer raises one either. Separating a true loss from
ordinary sparse numbering needs the game's own `ROUTEINFO` output, not arithmetic
over filenames.

### Wrap-around is inferred from the data, not tracked
Sequence numbers run 000-999. The validator finds the wrap by looking for a step
larger than 500 inside the window it was handed. That holds for a single wrap in
dense traffic, but it cannot tell a wrap from a genuinely large gap, and it has
nothing to say about a window spanning more than one wrap. Carrying an epoch
alongside the number would remove the guess.

### `passlib` is an unused dependency
`requirements.txt` pins `passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4` and `bcrypt==4.0.1` against a
compatibility problem that no longer applies: nothing imports passlib. Both the
application (`backend/core/security.py`, `backend/models/database.py`) and
`create_admin_sql.py` call bcrypt directly.

## Upgrading

Production is pinned to a tag and deploys from gitea. On `novahub-vtr`:

```bash
sudo -niu novahub /home/novahub/deploy.sh          # what is running, tags available
sudo -niu novahub /home/novahub/deploy.sh v0.3.1   # pin to a version
sudo systemctl restart nova-hub                    # deliberately separate
```

`deploy.sh` backs up the database, checks the tag out on a detached HEAD,
rebuilds the frontend, applies migrations and validates the config. It refuses to
run if the working tree is dirty, since checking out over hand-edited production
files would destroy them silently.

Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not restart the service -- that
stays a human decision. And it does not touch `config.toml` or `frontend/dist`,
both of which are gitignored; `dist` is rebuilt rather than delivered, which is
why a bare `git checkout` would otherwise leave the UI on the previous version.

After a restart, hard-reload the browser: `index.html` is not content-hashed, so
a cached copy keeps asking for the old bundle.
