"""Schemas for the attack-tracing view.

No unit counts in the listing: an admin who also plays must not learn an
attack's strength from the hub. What is there identifies an attack and times its
journey. The one exception is AttackForces, which only an admin can fetch, one
attack at a time, by clicking to reveal it.
