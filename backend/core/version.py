"""
backend/core/version.py

One place that knows what this build is.

The version string used to be repeated in three places in main.py and a fourth
in the frontend's package.json, which is exactly as reliable as it sounds. It
lives here now.

The revision and its date are read from git once, at import, and cached. This
deployment ships by patch and commit rather than by tag, so the commit is the
only honest answer to "what is running". Every lookup degrades to None rather
than raising: a tree deployed without .git, or without git installed, should
report an unknown revision, not fail to start.
