"""What moved between nodes, for an admin to look at.

Deliberately descriptive rather than diagnostic. The hub cannot tell a quiet
league from a broken one -- that depends on how many boards are playing and how
active their players are -- so this reports what happened and leaves the
judgement to someone who knows what their league should look like.

The data comes from the /DETAILED transcript of each processing run, stored per
item as the run finishes. See backend/services/transcript_service.py.
