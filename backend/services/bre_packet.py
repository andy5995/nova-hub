"""Read a BRE v0.988 InterBBS packet, and pull the attack traffic out of it.

The packets were described as encrypted and tamper-proofed. They are neither,
beyond a checksum: every record is plain structured data behind a zero-run
compressor, and "Test Realm" or "v0.988" can be read straight off a hex dump.
Everything below was established by differential capture on the test rig --
attacks sent with 37, 38 and 25 troopers, diffed byte for byte -- and checked
against the game's own `/DETAILED` transcript, whose per-record `Old:`/`Size:`
figures match the lengths decoded here exactly.

    file    = header(12)  record*  0x0F...
    header  = u32, rising over time  +  8 bytes not yet identified
    record  = type u8 | length u16le | src u8 | dst u8 | crc u32le | payload[length]
    crc     = zlib CRC-32 without the final xor, over the *compressed* payload
    payload = 0xFD n -> n zero bytes; 0xFD 0x00, or a final 0xFD, is a literal 0xFD;
              any other byte is literal

The 8 unidentified header bytes are not a CRC over any span of the file. They do
not stand between us and the records, so they are left for the memory-capture
route rather than guessed at.

**Why this exists: Missing In Transit.** An individual attack (0x07) carries an
8-byte attack ID. The defender's game answers with an Attack Result (0x08) that
is the original 875-byte record echoed back verbatim with 28 bytes of outcome
appended -- so the ID survives the round trip and an attack can be joined to its
result exactly, however many are in flight. Correlating by timing breaks down in
exactly the busy free-for-all stage when MITs matter most; the ID does not.

The attacker's game declares MIT when no result has arrived within the league's
"Days for Lost Attacks" (default 7). Forces come home, the attack achieves
nothing, and `PROBLEMS.LOG` says `Missing-In-Transit Attack Found to BBS #n`. A
result arriving after that is thrown away -- `Duplicate or Late Attack Return
Recieved - Packet Deleted` -- even though the defender has already taken the hit.
Both reproduced on the rig.

The timestamp in an attack record is also what the attacker's MIT report prints
as `Date:`, to the second. That is the join from what a player saw to the record
the hub carried.

Do not surface unit counts to anyone who also plays. Planets, realm letters, the
ID and the timestamps identify an attack; its strength is hidden game state.
`forces()` reads it for the one exception: an admin who asks, per attack, by
clicking to reveal it -- so an admin who plays never sees it by accident.
