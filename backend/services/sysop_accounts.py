"""
backend/services/sysop_accounts.py

Which hub account a provider identity signs in to.

An identity is bound to an account by its subject, the provider's permanent ID
for the person. The first sign-in with a new subject creates a sysop account:
not an admin, owning no BBS, so it sees nothing until an admin makes it the
owner of one. That is the "sysop signs up, admin assigns the owner" flow for
BBSes that predate accounts.

An identity is never bound to an existing account by matching email. Email is
how the provider identifies people, but the hub's own accounts (the admin's
above all) were not created by the provider, and an address match is not proof
that the same person holds both. An existing account is linked deliberately,
through an admin's re-link link.
