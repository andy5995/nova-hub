"""A league's resets: the ones performed from the console, and the ones the hub
only saw happen.

A BRE game's first PLANETARY after a league-wide reset sends every member a
Game Start record (0x10). It has the Configupdate's layout, so it carries the
start time and every other setting of the reset editor (bre_packet). Every Game
Start the hub passes is recorded here:

- right after a console reset, it confirms that reset: the start time and what
  was sent are filled in, and any setting that disagrees with the draft is
  listed in `sent_config["mismatches"]`;
- otherwise it is a reset done some other way (by hand, or before the console
  could), kept as an `observed` row so the history goes back further than the
  console does.

FE's packets aren't decoded yet, so an FE league's history is its console
resets only.
