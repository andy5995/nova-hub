"""Every setting the BRE and FE reset editors offer: one table for both games.

The table drives draft validation, the management API, the console form and
(later) the driver that types the answers into the editor, so none of them can
drift from the others. Labels, order, defaults and maximums were read off the
editors on the test rig (14 Oct 2026); see the design doc "Nova Hub: Game Reset
from the Console".

Things the editor does that the table encodes:

- Neither game has any minimum: every number field takes 0, and so does the
  form. `advised_min` is our judgement of where a smaller value stops a normal
  game, and `advised_reason` says why. It only warns: a 0 can be a real league
  choice later on, say a free-for-all stage where nobody can buy anything.
- Over the maximum, the editor puts the maximum on the prompt and waits for a
  second Enter. A driver typing one Enter falls out of step, so nothing past
  validation may carry an over-max value.
- A choice takes one letter. A letter the field does not allow is ignored, so
  `choices` lists only what the editor accepts (no None on Attack Damage).
- Sabre Constant asks a second question, a dial from 0 to 10; that is the
  dependent field `sabre_dial`.
- Dates are a date only. A typed date starts at 00:00; RESET itself stamps
  Start Date with the moment of the reset, so a blank one is left alone.
