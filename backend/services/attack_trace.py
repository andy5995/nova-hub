"""Follow each BRE attack through the hub, from launch to result.

A Missing In Transit is the attacker's game giving up: no result came back
within the league's "Days for Lost Attacks". From inside the game that is all
anyone can see. The hub carried every hop, though, and each attack carries an ID
its result echoes, so the hub can say exactly how far an attack got:

    launched            the attacker's session (game clock of the attacker's board)
    attack at hub       first packet the hub received it in
    attack delivered    the packet addressed to the target's board was taken
    result at hub       first packet the hub received the result in
    result delivered    the packet addressed back to the attacker was taken

The last stage reached is where it stopped. That is descriptive on purpose -- a
board that has not polled today is not a fault -- but where a result was handed
over after the MIT window, the game will have thrown it away, and saying so is
not a judgement call.

"Taken" means downloaded by the board's client, or, when the board is the hub's
own, processed by the hub's game.

Everything here is best-effort with respect to ingest: decoding a packet must
never be the reason a packet fails to be stored.
