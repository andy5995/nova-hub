"""
backend/services/nodelist_generator.py

Generate BRNODES.<league> / FENODES.<league> nodelist files from the database.

The format mirrors the BRE/FE nodes.dat format:
  <bbs_index>            -- or "<hub_index> HOST <idx> <idx> ..." for the hub
  <bbs_name>
  <fidonet_address>
  <city>
  <state>
  <country>
  (blank line)
  ...

Two things this file gets wrong if you let it: the hub's own entry, and the
HOST line.

The hub is node 1 of every league it runs, but it is not a Client row -- it has
no OAuth credentials and never syncs -- so iterating memberships alone produces
a nodelist with no hub in it. Its name and index come from [hub] config and its
FidoNet address from League.hub_fidonet_address, which is per-league.

Line 1 of the hub's entry carries the routing topology in the game's own
"<index> HOST <targets...>" form. With no route.cfg present -- and none of the
production installs has one -- that line is the only thing telling the game
where mail goes, so a nodelist without it is not a degraded nodelist, it is a
broken one. The targets are exactly the league's member indices. League 013 is
the exception and carries a bare index, which League.hub_routes_mail records so
that generating a nodelist cannot quietly change how a league routes.

Because a partial nodelist is worse than a stale one, generate() refuses to
write anything it cannot construct completely and leaves the previous file in
place.
