"""
backend/services/nodelist_generator.py

Generate BRNODES.<league> / FENODES.<league> nodelist files from the database.

The format mirrors the BRE/FE nodes.dat format:
  <bbs_index>            -- or "<hub_index> HOST <idx> <idx> ..." for the hub
  <bbs_name>
  <fidonet_address>
  <city>
  <state>
  <country>
  (blank line)
  ...

Two things this file gets wrong if you let it: the hub's own entry, and the
HOST line.

The hub is node 1 of every league it runs, but it is not a Client row -- it has
no OAuth credentials and never syncs -- so iterating memberships alone produces
a nodelist with no hub in it. Its name and index come from [hub] config and its
FidoNet address from League.hub_fidonet_address, which is per-league.

Line 1 of the hub's entry carries the routing topology in the game's own
"<index> HOST <targets...>" form. With no route.cfg present -- and none of the
production installs has one -- that line is the only thing telling the game
where mail goes, so a nodelist without it is not a degraded nodelist, it is a
broken one. The targets are exactly the league's member indices. League 013 is
the exception and carries a bare index, which League.hub_routes_mail records so
that generating a nodelist cannot quietly change how a league routes.

Because a partial nodelist is worse than a stale one, generate() refuses to
write anything it cannot construct completely and leaves the previous file in
place.

Writing the file does not reach the members. They get a nodelist one way only:
the hub's own game sends BRNODES.<league> from its OUTBOUND after its nodes file
changes, and processing_service.handle_nodelist_file queues that to every member.
So generate() also puts the nodelist into the hub game's own nodes file, which
is what an admin used to do by hand. Both files are written only when the bytes
differ, so a regeneration that changes nothing does not make the game resend it
or log as if it had.
