"""Read a BRE/FE dosemu transcript for what actually moved between nodes.

The hub already stores every run's full transcript in `ProcessingRun.dosemu_log`,
and with `/DETAILED` in the processing command that transcript names each item
that crossed the wire -- its type, and which node sent it to which:

    DeCompress:  Old:  56  New:1448  %: 96.1%  Type: Recon Update   2-> 1
    Compress: Old: 1448  Size:   36  %: 97.5%  Type: Configupdate   1-> 2
    Outbound mail for SJ Team 1 - Node 2 created.

Not the contents -- the games do not reveal those -- but enough to see the shape
of the traffic and judge it by eye. That judgement is the point. A missing
sequence number has no single meaning (the games burn one at each game-day
rollover, so one lone gap a day per route is normal and indistinguishable from a
real loss), which makes it a poor thing to ring a bell about and a fine thing to
show someone who knows what the league should look like.

Two transcript quirks that any reader has to survive, both found in real logs:

* **The screen is repainted.** In dosemu's vga mode the emulated display is
  rewritten many times a run, so the same line appears repeatedly and counting
  raw matches overcounts wildly. Records are de-duplicated on their full content.
* **Repaints run records together.** A painted line can read
  `...Type: Recon Update   4-> 1DeCompress:  Old: 2 ...` with no separator, so a
  loose type pattern swallows the next record whole and invents a type like
  "Recon Request DeCompress: Old: 2 New: 2". Type names are words, spaces and
  slashes, never a colon, and pinning that down is what stops it. The truncated
  half is dropped rather than guessed at -- the repaint always carries an intact
  copy elsewhere, which is why the record counts are unchanged by the fix.
