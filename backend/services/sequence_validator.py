# sequence_epoch, which is where the 000-999 space is now reasoned about.
MAX_SEQUENCE = 999

# Wrap-around used to be *inferred* here, by looking for one suspiciously large
# gap in the sorted numbers and splicing the list at it. That could represent
# exactly one wrap, and production passed that point long ago: league 3's route
# 02->01 has sent 5,891 packets over six complete cycles, which collapse into a
# flawless 000-999 run with no gap for the detector to find. It has been blind on
# its busiest routes for months.
#
# Cycles are now *counted* from arrival order instead -- see sequence_epoch --
# and everything below works in an absolute space that only increases, where a
# wrap is a step of one like any other and needs no special case at all.

# A route's sequence numbers are NOT dense. BRE and FE consume more than one
# number per packet they actually emit -- in the rig, each new game day burns two
# and writes its file at the second, so a perfectly healthy install produces
# .002, .004, .006 with nothing lost and nothing delayed. Treating every unseen
# number as a lost packet is what produced 705 unresolved alerts in production,
# all of them false, which made a genuine loss unfindable.
#
# So instead of assuming a stride of 1, learn the stride the route actually uses
# and alert only on departures from it. Two equal gaps in a row is the minimum
# evidence accepted: that is three consecutive packets spaced identically, and
# requiring more would leave a young route noisy for its first week. Where the
# evidence is weaker the stride falls back to 1, which is the old behaviour --
# this only ever makes the detector quieter where it has grounds to be.
MIN_DELTAS_FOR_STRIDE = 2
STRIDE_DOMINANCE = 0.6

# A stride only helps where there IS one. Measured against eight months of
# production data, the three BRE leagues number densely -- 1000 packets covering
# 1000 numbers, every step exactly 1 -- and Falcon's Eye does not. 015F's routes
# step by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and occasionally 45, with no value holding a majority, and
# they carry 472 of production's 492 standing alerts between them. One route sent
# 103 packets across a span of 328 numbers: that is not 225 lost packets, it is a
# game that does not number densely, and no stride can be read from it.
#
# So the second question, asked before any gap is reported: does this route's
# numbering support the inference at all? Density is packets per number of span,
# which is just the reciprocal of the mean step, and it separates the two
# populations cleanly -- 1.00 and 0.98 for BRE, 0.31 to 0.66 for FE.
#
# Below the threshold the route is exempt: its unseen numbers are not evidence of
# anything. That does lose the ability to spot a genuine FE loss, which is the
# honest cost of the trade -- an alarm that has fired 472 times without once being
# real has no value to trade away. Telling the two apart needs the game's own
# record of what it sent (ROUTEINFO), not arithmetic on what arrived.
#
# The minimum sample matters as much as the threshold: a route with six packets
# can look sparse by accident, so below MIN_PACKETS_FOR_DENSITY the route stays
# noisy rather than being quietly excused.
MIN_PACKETS_FOR_DENSITY = 20
DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 0.9


# Routes the hub itself sends on cannot be judged for gaps, and the reason is
# structural rather than a threshold to tune.
#
# Inbound packets arrive over the API and each upload creates its own row, so a
# route like 02->01 holds a true history -- production's has 5,891 rows across
# 1,000 numbers, which is exactly what makes counting cycles worthwhile. Packets
# the hub *generates* go through collect_outbound_packets instead, which on a
# filename collision deliberately updates the existing row rather than adding
# one (it resets is_downloaded so the client re-fetches). That is correct for
# delivery and fatal for history: once such a route has been round the numbering
# its rows stop being packets and become a fixed table of 1,000 slots.
#
# Ask that table for gaps and it answers "none", every time, whatever happened.
# Confirmed on the rig: 1,100 forced cycles rolled 999 -> 000 at cycle 1,002 and
# then reissued 900b0102.002 onwards with fresh contents under names already
# used. A false all-clear is worse than no answer, so these routes are skipped.

# How recent a gap must be to be worth an alert, when the config does not say.
# Two weeks is well past the point where a missing attach can be chased and well
# short of turning the alert list into an archive.
DEFAULT_ALERT_MAX_AGE_DAYS = 14

# Whether a missing sequence number should raise an alert at all, when the config
# does not say. It should not, and the reason is measured rather than cautious.
#
# Both games burn a sequence number at each game-day rollover -- they consume one
# and emit nothing. Across eight months of production data every busy route shows
# exactly one lone missing number per active day: 232 days out of 239 on one
# route, 237 of 241 on another, 109 of 111 on a third, each at that route's own
# maintenance time. A lone daily gap is therefore the normal working of the game,
# and it is indistinguishable from a packet that genuinely went missing.
#
# So an alert on a single missing number is not evidence of anything. Enabled, it
# fires about three times a day on production and every one of them is the
# rollover; the real loss it exists to catch then arrives as the fourth identical
# line that day. That is how the previous detector accumulated 705 unresolved
# false alerts and made a genuine loss unfindable.
#
# What replaced it is the movements view: the games' own account of what they
# exchanged, shown to an admin who knows what their league should look like.
# Set this true to get the alerts back; the gaps are detected and recorded either
# way, so nothing is lost by leaving it off.
