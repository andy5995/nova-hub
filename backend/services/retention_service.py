"""Honour `[processing] retention_days`.

The setting has shipped in `config.toml.example` since the beginning and been
parsed into `ProcessingConfig` the whole time, and nothing has ever read it.
An operator reading that config had every reason to believe old data was pruned
at thirty days. It never was: production reached 478 MB across eight months,
92% of it older than the retention window it thought it had, growing ~700 MB a
year with no ceiling. A setting that lies is worse than no setting.

**Two-tier, not delete.** What is big and what is worth keeping are not the same
rows -- they are different *columns* of the same rows:

| | |
|---|---|
| `processing_runs` | 267 MB, essentially all of it `dosemu_log` |
| `processing_run_files` | 179 MB over 170k rows, essentially all `file_data` |
| `packets` | 8 MB |

So retention drops the bulk text and keeps the row. Run history, counts, exit
codes, per-league attribution and the sequence record all survive; the 18 KB
transcript of a run nobody has looked at since February does not. `file_size`
is left as it was, so the row still says how big the thing was.

No *row* is deleted outright. That is deliberate: every id stays valid, no
foreign key is orphaned, and a purge cannot cascade into data somebody still
needs. It also means the pass is re-runnable and its effect is monotonic.

**The same setting has a filesystem half.** `dosemu_runner` writes every
transcript to `<data_dir>/logs/dosemu/*.log` before `processing_service` reads it
into `ProcessingRun.dosemu_log`, so the text exists twice. Blanking the column
and leaving the file behind honours the setting only halfway, which is how
production accumulated 53,930 log files and 860 MB over eight months while the
database tier was working correctly. Aged log files are therefore deleted -- and
here deletion is right, because the file is the bulk content, there is no row to
preserve, and anything still inside the window keeps both copies.
