backend/services/claim_links.py

Claim links: how a BBS gets its client credentials without anyone sending a
secret over chat.

An admin issues a link from the BBS's page. The link carries a random token;
the database keeps only the token's SHA-256. Nothing secret exists yet. When
the sysop opens the link and presses Claim, a new client secret is generated,
its hash replaces the old one, and the plaintext goes back in that one response
-- with a config file already filled in -- and is never stored or shown again.

So a link is only worth something until it is used, it is used at most once,
and a sysop who finds it already claimed knows someone else got there first.
Issuing a new link supersedes any outstanding one for the same BBS.

Opening the link (GET) only reports its state. Claiming is a separate POST, so
the preview fetch a chat app makes when the link is pasted cannot use it up.

A link may be bound to an account. Then only that account, signed in, can
claim it, so a link that is forwarded or read over someone's shoulder is
useless to anyone else. Approving an application issues one bound to the
applicant. An unbound link -- possession is the credential -- is for a BBS
whose sysop has no account.
