"""A packet the hub's game writes keeps its own row, even after its name recurs.

Until this was changed the collector reused the row whenever a filename came
round again, so a hub-originated route was a table of 1,000 slots: after a wrap
the row said the new packet had arrived months ago, and the old packet -- when
it was written, when its board took it, the relayed attack it carried -- was
gone. In production that erased the relay hop of every attack older than about
a thousand packets on its route, which the Attacks view then showed as a result
never delivered.

A name that recurs while its row is still waiting to be downloaded is the same
packet rewritten, and still updates in place.
