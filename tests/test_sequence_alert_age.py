"""Only raise a sequence alert while somebody could still act on it.

A missing packet is worth an alarm for as long as it might be chased -- a player
reports an attach went missing in transit, and the hub can name the number that
never arrived on which route. Past that it is history, and history in an alert
list is worse than useless: it is where the next real one goes to hide.

This bites hardest on the first run after the epoch model ships. Counting cycles
rather than inferring a single wrap means the detector can suddenly see the
whole history it was blind to, and against production's real data that is 623
gaps reaching back to January. All of them would be raised at once.

The gaps are still found and still counted. They just stop ringing a bell.
