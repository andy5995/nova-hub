"""Every Management API route says who may call it.

With sysop sign-up, any provider user can hold a session. So a route that
takes only get_current_user would show a fresh sysop everything. Each route
must depend on require_admin, or on get_scope (and filter by it), or be on
one of the short lists below, which say why.
