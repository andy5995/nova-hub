"""The hub's own outbound routes cannot be judged for gaps.

Packets clients upload each create their own row, so an inbound route holds a
true history. Packets the hub generates go through collect_outbound_packets,
which on a filename collision used to update the existing row instead of adding
one -- correct for delivery, fatal for history. Once such a route has been round
the 000-999 numbering, its rows are a fixed table of 1,000 slots and asking it
for gaps returns "none" no matter what happened. The collector now adds a row
per packet (tests/test_outbound_history.py), but every hub route in production
was already a slot table by then, so the skip stays.

Reproduced on the rig: 1,100 forced cycles rolled 999 -> 000 at cycle 1,002 and
then reissued 900b0102.002 onward with fresh contents under names already used.
