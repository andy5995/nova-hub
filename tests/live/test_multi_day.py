"""Scenario 8 - game time, and what it does to sequence numbers.

`REDATE.COM` hooks int 21h AH=2Ah (GET-DATE), which is exactly where Turbo
Pascal's GetDate goes, so the game sees a faked date and nothing else does.
`node_rig.run(..., date="YYYYMMDD")` installs it, runs the command, and removes
it again.

The reason this scenario is worth more than "days pass": it is the only way to
see what a real game does to sequence numbers over time, and what it does is not
what the hub assumes.

Two things about game time that every test here has to respect, both learned the
hard way on 2026-10-27:

1. Dates only move forward. The game refuses to run a date before its own last
   run, and a fresh RESET stamps the fixture with today, so no hardcoded
   constant survives contact with the calendar. These dates are derived.

2. WHICH game day emits a packet is governed by the absolute date, not by the
   day's index in the run. The same calendar dates emit regardless of where in a
   run they fall, measured across windows starting +1, +2, +3, +20, +36 and +67
   days from the reset. So "three consecutive game days" is not a repeatable
   quantity of traffic, and anything that needs N packets has to play until it
   has N packets rather than assume a fixed number of days will supply them.
   That is what _play_until is for.
