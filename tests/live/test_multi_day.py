"""Scenario 8 - game time, and what it does to sequence numbers.

`REDATE.COM` hooks int 21h AH=2Ah (GET-DATE), which is exactly where Turbo
Pascal's GetDate goes, so the game sees a faked date and nothing else does.
`node_rig.run(..., date="YYYYMMDD")` installs it, runs the command, and removes
it again.

The reason this scenario is worth more than "days pass": it is the only way to
see what a real game does to sequence numbers over time, and what it does is not
what the hub assumes.
