"""Scenario - traffic a player generated, not maintenance.

Every other live scenario drives the games the way the hub does: unattended
maintenance. That covers the plumbing, but it cannot produce the two things a
league actually carries once people are in it -- a score that changed because
somebody took a turn, and a message somebody wrote. An idle league emits on days
one, two and three and then goes quiet, so without a player there is nothing left
to move.

`rig.player` is the missing half: it drives BRE.EXE FULL, which `node.run()`
refuses by design.
