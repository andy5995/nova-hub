"""The R-3 detector: a game that is handed packets it cannot read.

Production league fe_015 has an inbound path in BBS.CFG that the game cannot
traverse. Nothing reports it. The run completes, every phase marker prints, the
exit code is zero -- and not one packet is ingested. Before this, the hub then
deleted the untouched packets from the game inbound, so the evidence and the
retry both went in the same bin.

Two halves here: the cheap structural check that can be run against any config
including production, and the live proof that a broken path is now detected and
that repairing it recovers on its own.
