"""A nodelist the hub generates reaches every member, through the hub's own game.

Members get a nodelist one way: the hub's game sends BRNODES.<league> from its
OUTBOUND after its own nodes file changes, and the hub queues that to each
member. Generating used to write only the hub-side copy, so a board added
through self-service never reached anyone (prod 015, Oct 2026). Generation now
writes the hub game's nodes file too; this proves the real game takes it from
there.
