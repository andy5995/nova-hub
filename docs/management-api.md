## Management API - Address Book

### GET `/management/api/v1/address-book`

**Address Book**

Every BBS against every active league: its index and FTN address in each,
and whether its index differs between leagues.

Only active memberships are listed. BBSes in no league are included, so a
newly added one shows up here before it joins anything.

A sysop sees only their own leagues, the BBSes in them, and the addresses
those BBSes use there -- what the leagues' nodelists publish.

### POST `/management/api/v1/applications/{application_id}/approve`

**Approve Application**

Approve, granting each league with the BBS index and FTN address given (admin only).

A join creates the BBS, makes the applicant its owner, and returns a claim
link bound to the applicant: only they, signed in, can use it, and it
also waits for them in the console. The leagues' nodelists are
regenerated; `nodelist_problems` lists any that could not be, which leaves
the approval standing. 409 with the reason if it can't be approved as given.

  due date, so discarded), `possible` (handed over while it rolled over, or no
  rollover seen yet), `overdue` (past the due date, no result delivered), or `any`

reveal is logged.

### GET `/management/api/v1/auth/sso/start`

**Start Provider Sign-in**

Send the browser to the identity provider to sign in.

A random state goes both into the provider URL and, signed, into a short-lived
cookie; the callback accepts only a state that matches its own browser's
cookie, so a sign-in cannot be started in one browser and finished in another.

  - Type: `string`
  - Location: query

**relink**
- A re-link link's token: bind this sign-in to the account it was issued for

credentials together with ready-made client config files (Linux
`config.toml`, Windows `config.psd1`) listing the BBS's leagues. 409 if
the link has been used, superseded or has expired. A bound link needs its
account signed in: 401 when no one is, 403 when someone else is.

### POST `/management/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/claim-link`

**Issue Claim Link**

Issue a single-use link that gives this BBS's sysop its credentials (admin only).

Send the link instead of a secret. It expires after 72 hours and supersedes
any outstanding link for this BBS. Nothing changes for the BBS until the
link is claimed; claiming generates a new secret, which replaces the
current one.

**Request Body (optional):** `user_id` binds the link to one of the BBS's
owners: only that account, signed in, can claim it, and it waits for them
in the console too. Without it the link is unbound, for a sysop with no
account.

**Returns:** the link (shown only here) and its expiry

#### Parameters

**client_id**
  - Type: `integer`
  - Location: path *(required)*

### GET `/management/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/claim-link`

### POST `/management/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/claim-link/collect`

**Collect Claim Link**

The claim link waiting for the signed-in sysop, as a link they can open.

Only the link's hash is kept, so the one the admin was shown can't be
shown again: this replaces it with a new one, bound to the same account
and expiring at the same time, and returns that. 404 when no link is
waiting for this account -- a sysop can't rotate their BBS's secret this
way, only collect what the admin issued.

#### Parameters

**client_id**

### POST `/management/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/regenerate-secret`

**Regenerate Secret**

Regenerate client OAuth2 secret (an admin, or a sysop who owns the BBS)

With no body, or `overlap_hours` 0, the old secret stops now, and so do
the access tokens already issued with it. With `overlap_hours` (up to 72)
the old secret keeps working that long, so the node isn't cut off before
its config is edited.

**Path Parameters:**
- `client_id`: Database ID of the client

**Returns:** New client secret (shown only once), and when the old one stops

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://hub.example.com/management/api/v1/clients/1/regenerate-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"overlap_hours": 24}' \

### GET `/management/api/v1/clients/{client_id}/config/{platform}`

**Download Sample Client Config**

Download a sample client config for this BBS: the file a claim hands back,
without the secret.

The hub keeps only the secret's hash, so `client_secret` is a CHANGE-ME
placeholder, like the game paths. The hub address, client ID, BBS name and
current leagues with their BBS indexes are filled in.

**Path Parameters:**
- `client_id`: Database ID of the client
- `platform`: `linux` (`config.toml`, Python client) or `windows`
  (`config.psd1`, PowerShell client)

#### Parameters

**client_id**
  - Type: `integer`
  - Location: path *(required)*

**platform**

## Management API - Game Reset

### GET `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/reset`

**Get the Game Reset Form**

Every setting the game's reset editor offers, in the editor's order, with
the game's own help, its default and our limits; the league's draft, if any;
the settings of the last reset performed from the console; and what the hub
last decoded from the league's Configupdate.

### PUT `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/reset/draft`

**Save the Game Reset Draft**

Check every setting against the game's limits and save the league's draft.

A value below our advised minimum is saved, and listed in the draft's
`warnings`.

Answers 422 listing each field that fails, and 409 when someone else saved the
draft since `version` was loaded. Fields left out take the game's defaults.

### POST `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/reset/perform`

**Perform the Game Reset**

Reset the league's game with its draft. **Every player on every board in
the league is wiped** once members run the Game Start this sends.

The draft must be at `version`, and `confirm` must be the league's code. The
hub then backs up the game, types the draft into the game's own reset
editor, checks every setting on both pages, and saves it as a league-wide
reset; a PLANETARY run then sends the Game Start. Anything unexpected before
the save puts the game back as it was and returns the settings to the draft.

Answers 202 at once with the reset under way; follow it with
`GET /leagues/{id}/resets/{reset_id}`. 409 when another reset is running or
the draft changed; 422 when the code is wrong, the draft no longer passes,
or the game isn't where config.toml says.

**league_id**

### GET `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/nodelist`

Download the league's current BRNODES/FENODES nodelist.

The same file nova_client fetches through the service API: the one the last
processing run (or Generate Nodelist) wrote. Fetching it here does not mark
it downloaded for any BBS.

**Path Parameters:**
- `league_id`: Database ID of the league

**Returns:** the nodelist file; 404 if none has been generated yet

### POST `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/generate-nodelist`

**Generate Nodelist**

Generate a BRNODES/FENODES nodelist file from the current league membership (admin only).

The file is written to the nodelists directory, where the console and the
service API's bootstrap download serve it, and into the hub's own game as
its nodes file (only if that changes it). The game sends it to every member
on its next run, as it does when the file is edited by hand.

**Path Parameters:**
- `league_id`: Database ID of the league

**Returns:** `{"filename": ..., "members": <count>, "warnings": [...]}`; a
warning means the hub's game was not given the nodelist (no `game_folder`,
say), so the members will not receive it.

#### Parameters

**league_id**

### PATCH `/management/api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/members/{membership_id}`

**Edit Member**

Edit a league membership's BBS index and/or FTN address (admin only)

Both fields are validated before either is written, so a rejected edit
leaves the membership exactly as it was. The league's nodelist picks the
change up at its next regeneration.

**Path Parameters:**
- `league_id`: Database ID of the league
- `membership_id`: Database ID of the membership

**Request Body** (at least one):
- `bbs_index`: New BBS index (1-255)
- `ftn_address_id`: One of the client's own FTN addresses

**Returns:** The updated membership

**Example:**
```bash

### GET `/management/api/v1/movements/summary`

**Summarise Item Movements**

The shape of the traffic: by type, by node pair, and by day.

`quiet_nodes` lists boards this league has exchanged nothing with in the
window, which is the one thing worth pointing at -- not because it is

question an admin would otherwise have to work out by reading the table.
